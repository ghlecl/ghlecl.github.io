<p>This is one of my first posts.
I have been toying with the idea of this blog for quite some time now.
A flaw of mine: too much searching for the best solution, not enough implementing.
I end up doing things too late.
Anyhow, I digress.</p>
<p>One of the relevant questions when thinking of writing a blog is of course where to publish and what tool(s) to use.
At some point, I was thinking of hosting on an old computer of mine.
Played with the different servers (compiled <a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>, <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a> and <a href="https://www.nginx.com">Nginx</a>).
Then, I realized all the time involved in maintaining my own server and changed my mind.
I did not want to deal with the security updates and the log checking (or the program checking the logs...).
Not that I am naïve enough to think my content is worth hacking, but using my machine on a bot net or whatnot might be.</p>
<p>After that, I started looking into shared hosting.
That could have worked, I even paid for a few months, but did nothing productive.
Was still learning everything and for some reason (a friend of mine would say control issues, but who knows really !), I did not want to go with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>,
<a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> or another content management system.
That seemed like overkill for my needs and yes, I like to control things on my computer a little too much for my own good and I did not feel I could get control over those behemoths in a reasonable timeframe.
Most of the shared hosting I looked into (probably not exhaustive) seemed pre-configured for the CMS like systems, but not for other things and I found myself again trying to configure Apache on the shared host.</p>
<p>I gave up for a while.
I was busy with other things; but lately, I have been coming back to the idea of this blog.
Hence my looking into all those things again.
That's when a very good friend of mine suggested I look into <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
The idea is very interesting and if someone else is reading this, it means I actually went through with this.
I personally have two basic needs for a server: 1) writing a blog (and maybe a private section as a journal) and 2) hosting private projects on Git.
With GitHub Pages, I can actually easily create the blog and if I pay for a GitHub account, I believe I should be able to do the private journal and the Git hosting as well.
The monthly cost will be roughly the same as a hosted plan and I will have almost zero if not zero administration to do.</p>
<p>So that's how I came to GitHub pages!  I am sure that since I am a novice at the Internet (well creating content other then on my Facebook account), there are some assumptions I have made that are wrong and my solution might be sub-optimal, but it works for me.</p>
<p>Now, let's see if I can make a habit of writing.</p>
