<h1 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h1>

<p>This is one of my first posts.  I have been toying with the idea of this blog for
quite some time now.  A flaw of mine: too much searching for the best solution,
not enough implementing.  I end up doing things too late.  Anyhow, I digress.</p>

<p>One of the relevant questions when thinking of writing a blog is of course where
to publish and what tool(s) to use.  At some point, I was thinking of hosting on
an old computer of mine.  Played with the different servers (compiled
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache</a>, <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net" target="_blank">lighttpd</a> and
<a href="https://www.nginx.com" target="_blank">Nginx</a>).  Then, I realized all the time involved in
maintaining my own server and changed my mind.  I did not want to deal with the
security updates and the log checking (or the program checking the logs&hellip;).  Not
that I am naïve enough to think my content is worth hacking, but using my machine
on a bot net or whatnot might be.</p>

<p>After that, I started looking into shared hosting.  That could have worked, I
even paid for a few months, but did nothing productive.  Was still learning
everything and for some reason (a friend of mine would say control issues, but who
knows really !), I did not want to go with <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>,
<a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a> or another content management system.  That
seemed like overkill for my needs and yes, I like to control things on my computer
a little too much for my own good and I did not feel I could get control over
those behemoths in a reasonable timeframe.  Most of the shared hosting I looked
into (probably not exhaustive) seemed pre-configured for the CMS like systems, but
not for other things and I found myself again trying to configure Apache on the
shared host.</p>

<p>I gave up for a while.  I was busy with other things; but lately, I have been
coming back to the idea of this blog.  Hence my looking into all those things
again.  That&rsquo;s when a very good friend of mine suggested I look into
<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.  The idea is very interesting and if
someone else is reading this, it means I actually went through with this.  I
personally have two basic needs for a server: 1) writing a blog (and maybe a
private section as a journal) and 2) hosting private projects on Git.  With
GitHub Pages, I can actually easily create the blog and if I pay for a GitHub
account, I believe I should be able to do the private journal and the Git hosting
as well.  The monthly cost will be roughly the same as a hosted plan and I will
have almost zero if not zero administration to do.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how I came to GitHub pages!  I am sure that since I am a novice at the
Internet (well creating content other then on my Facebook account), there are some
assumptions I have made that are wrong and my solution might be sub-optimal, but
it works for me.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see if I can make a habit of writing.</p>
