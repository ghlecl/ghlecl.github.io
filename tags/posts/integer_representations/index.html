<h1 id="integer-binary-representations">Integer binary representations</h1>

<p>I had never had to look closely at integer binary representations in computers.
The mental model I had for them was not wrong, but it turns out it was sub-optimal
and there are better ways to do things.  If you use high level abstractions and
do not mainly work with fundamental types, or if you do not convert between integer
types, you do not have to be mindful of the binary representation of integers
all the time as you program.  Thus, before the last few weeks, I never had to look
more closely at that, but I have started a project for which binary representation
had a direct effect and I finally looked into them.  I thought I would write down
some notes and observations.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that this is probably covered in all computer science degrees
and so might seem trivial and basic knowledge to many programmers, but since I
don&rsquo;t have a CS degree and never had to think much about binary representation,
this was informative to me!  I should also point out that although I have used
the C and C++ standards as references, the concepts here are not exclusive to
these languages.</p>

<h2 id="unsigned-integers">Unsigned integers</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1570.pdf" target="_blank">C standard</a> is
explicit in its definition of unsigned integers (at least up to C11, the latest
standard at the time of writing).  It can be found in
section&nbsp;<strong>6.2.6.2&nbsp;Integer types</strong>, paragraph&nbsp;1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, the bits of the object
representation shall be divided into two groups: value bits and padding bits
(there need not be any of the latter). If there are <code>N</code> value bits, each bit
shall represent a different power of 2 between 1 and 2<sup><code>N</code>−1</sup>, so that
objects of that type shall be capable of representing values from 0 to
2<sup><code>N</code></sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 using a pure binary representation; this shall
be known as the value representation. The values of any padding bits are
unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is sometimes referred to as the pure binary representation.  Other than the
fact that the wording confused me at first<sup>[1]</sup>, this basically describes
a usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number" target="_blank">binary</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation" target="_blank">positional number notation</a>,
which is much like the decimal positional number notation we commonly use but
forget about. This is rather intuitive if you are familiar with positional number
systems.  The most significant bit position (<em>i.e.</em> the largest exponent bit) is
not specified in the standard as it varies with hardware (and is more complicated
then it seems if you get into byte ordering on top of that). The range of the pure
binary unsigned representation is the following:
<p style="text-align: center;">
0 &ensp; to &ensp; 2<sup><code>n</code></sup> &ndash; 1
</p></p>

<p>where <code>n</code> is the number of bits used in the representation.  That is how you get
to the range&nbsp;0 to&nbsp;255 (= 2<sup>8</sup> &ndash; 1) for an&nbsp;8&nbsp;bit
number.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/n4659.pdf" target="_blank">C++ standard</a>
is more vague on the subject (at least up to C++17, the latest standard at the
time of writing).  As far as I can tell, it does not impose an explicit
representation for its unsigned type.  Section <strong>6.9 Types</strong> of the standard deals
with type representations and the closest I have found to having an explicit
representation specified for unsigned types is footnote 45 which says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The intent is that the memory model of C++ is compatible with that of ISO/IEC
9899 Programming Language C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which would suggest, I think, that the type representations have to be compatible.
But that is not exactly explicit.  Then, in paragraph 3, section
<strong>6.9.1&nbsp;Fundamental types</strong>, the standard says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The range of non-negative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the
corresponding unsigned integer type, the representation of the same value in
each of the two types is the same, and the value representation of each
corresponding signed/unsigned type shall be the same. [&hellip;]  The signed and
unsigned integer types shall satisfy the constraints given in the C standard,
section 5.2.4.2.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not imply a pure binary representation.  That said, most if not all C++
implementations in the field will actually have a pure binary representation for
unsigned integers.</p>

<h2 id="signed-integers">Signed integers</h2>

<p>There are a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations" target="_blank">signed integer representations</a> and, for now at
least<sup>[2]</sup>, none of them is explicitly specified (or forbidden) by the
C or C++ standards.  I have looked at three different representations, the last
one being the most common if I understand correctly.</p>

<h3 id="signed-magnitude">Signed magnitude</h3>

<p><a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations#
Signed_magnitude_representation)" target="_blank">Signed magnitude</a> is the obvious solution to the problem: take
the first bit and make it a sign bit, <em>i.e.</em> model the + or &ndash; sign as a 0
or a 1.  This is actually the mental model I had for signed integers.  The range
of this solution is:
<p style="text-align: center;">
&ndash;(2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup> &ndash; 1)  &ensp;
                        to &ensp; 2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup> &ndash; 1
</p></p>

<p>where <code>n</code> is the number of bits in the representation.  This gives only one less
number then the unsigned solution, because there are now two bit patterns that
represent 0.  For instance, for 8 bits, both:
<p style="text-align: center;">
<code>00000000</code> &emsp; and &emsp; <code>10000000</code>
</p></p>

<p>represent the number zero (albeit, positive 0 and negative 0).  This is not
really a problem although comparison with zero now has to check for two cases.</p>

<p>Although the signed magnitude approach seems very natural, it makes the hardware
to do simple arithmetic operations&nbsp;(+, &ndash;) more complex to write.
<a href="https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps104/fall98/lectures/week1-l2/tsld021.htm" target="_blank">From what</a>
<a href="http://scientific-solutions.com/products/faq/ssi_faq_bin_sm_2comp.shtml" target="_blank">I read</a>
(I am no expert), this is mostly because the sign bit has to be dealt with before
the operation and the circuitry becomes more complex.  It is mainly for this
reason that other approaches have been developed.</p>

<h3 id="one-s-complement">One&rsquo;s complement</h3>

<p>In the <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement)" target="_blank">one&rsquo;s complement</a>
signed number representation, a negative number is obtained by taking the
complement of its unsigned representation, <em>i.e.</em> inverting every bit.  The range
of this binary representation is the same as that of the signed magnitude
representation, for the exact same reason: there are two ways of representing the
number 0.  So, again, the range is:
<p style="text-align: center;">
&ndash;(2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup> &ndash; 1) &ensp;
                  to &ensp; 2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup> &ndash; 1
</p></p>

<p>where <code>n</code> is the number of bits in the representation and again, there are two
representations of zero, albeit not the same as for signed magnitude (e.g.
for&nbsp;8 bits):
<p style="text-align: center;">
<code>00000000</code> &emsp; and &emsp; <code>11111111</code>
</p></p>

<p>This binary representation makes algorithms for the addition and subtraction of
integers much simpler than the signed magnitude representation.  With one&rsquo;s
complement encoding, the usual algorithm that we do by hand for addition works and
yields the correct value so long as the leftmost carry bit is added back to the
result (if it is 0, that&rsquo;s fairly easy ;-) ).  There is a way to remove the need
to add back the carry bit and that is one characteristic of the next
representation discussed.</p>

<h3 id="two-s-complement">Two&rsquo;s complement</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" target="_blank">Two&rsquo;s complement</a> is the last
method discussed (although not the last one there is, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations" target="_blank">Wikipedia&rsquo;s article</a>
for at least two more).  This binary representation scheme is, today at least,
the most prevalent signed integer representation in hardware. This encoding is
almost the same as one&rsquo;s complement, except that once you have calculated the
inverted bits of the number, you add one to it.  Two&rsquo;s complement range is:
<p style="text-align: center;">
&ndash;(2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup>) &ensp;
                     to &ensp; 2<sup>(<code>n</code> &ndash; 1)</sup> &ndash; 1
</p></p>

<p>where <code>n</code> is the number of bits in the representation.  It should be noted that
the range is not exactly the same as the one&rsquo;s complement: it is larger by one.
This is explained by the fact that in this encoding scheme, there is only one
representation of&nbsp;0, and it is the same as the unsigned&nbsp;0, <em>i.e.</em> all
bits set to&nbsp;0.  Opposed to the one&rsquo;s complement representation, in this
scheme, when all the bits are set to&nbsp;1, the value encoded is not&nbsp;0, but
rather the smallest negative number (<em>i.e.</em>&nbsp;-1).  For&nbsp;8&nbsp;bits, the
first row of the following table illustrates this:
<table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
   <tr>
      <th style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">bits<br></th>
      <th style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">two&rsquo;s<br/>complement</td>
      <th style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">unsigned</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">11111111<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">-1</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">255</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">01111111<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">127</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">127</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">10000000<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">-128</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">128</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">10000001<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">-127</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">129</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">11010111<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">-41</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">215</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">11111110<br></td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">-2</td>
      <td style="padding:0px 15px;text-align:center;">254</td>
   </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Practically, when you get to the largest signed (positive) integer you can
represent with the number of bits available, if you increment by one, the bit
pattern becomes that of the lowest signed (negative) integer you can represent
(which is illustrated in the second and third rows of the table above).  After
that, increasing the bit pattern by&nbsp;1 will increase the value by one (fourth
row of the table).  Citing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement#Why_it_works" target="_blank">Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry on two&rsquo;s complement</a><sup>[3]</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally, the system represents negative integers by counting backward and
wrapping around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This representation then has the interesting property that when going from unsigned
to signed or vice-versa by only reinterpreting the bit pattern as if it were the
destination type, the behavior is that of modulo 2<sup><code>n</code>-1</sup> wrapping (which
is the same as the wrapping behavior mandated by the C standard for unsigned
integers: wrapping to the value of the highest value plus one).</p>

<p>Another property of this encoding scheme, and probably a more significant
advantage compared to the single representation of zero, is that the carry bit
for the usual algorithm of arithmetic operations (additions, subtractions) must
simply be ignored to give the correct result.  This differs from the one&rsquo;s
complement encoding scheme, where it has to be added back.  Thus, arithmetic
operations are even simpler to implement.  This is probably a big reason why two&rsquo;s
complement is the dominating binary representation right now.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I never had to think much about the binary representation of the integers I used.
I guess that can be attributed to me never working on the kind of applications
where it matters or always working with a single architecture.  Given that I do
not, for instance, often do binary file manipulation or networking, I am not sure
I will personally use this knowledge very often, but in any case, it is good to
know.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p><sup>[1]</sup>The standard talks about the values represented and not the
exponent, so that it talks about the series:</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp; 1, 2, 4, 8, 16&hellip;</p>

<p>of successive evaluations of the exponents of 2 rather than the successive
exponents themselves, which actually start at zero.  This had confused me at
first, but <a href="http://h-deb.clg.qc.ca/" target="_blank">Patrice Roy</a> and
<a href="http://www.aaronballman.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Ballman</a> helped me see that I had
misinterpreted the standard.  Thanks to both of them.</p>

<p><sup>[2]</sup>In the 2018 Jacksonville meeting of the ISO C++ Committee, a paper
has been presented to officially <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html" target="_blank">make signed integers two&rsquo;s complement</a>.  There
is no certainty on the future of this paper, but the idea was also presented to
the C standard committee and the discussions in both committee will take place to
see if this is something they will pursue.</p>
